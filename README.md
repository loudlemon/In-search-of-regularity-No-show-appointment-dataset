## In search of regularity:No-show appointments dataset
### Part of Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree

### I chose this dataset to answer a few questions about people, who didn't show up on their appoinments
### These questions are:
   - Is it useful to send SMS reminders about appoinment date?
   - Does "Bolsa Familia" programm make people more conscious about their health?
   - Which deseases has the most influence on people's behaviour?
   
### The project investigates the stated questions from multiple angles.Variables are investigated
### using both single-variable (1d) and multiple-variable (2d) explorations.
